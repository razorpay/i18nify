Data Source:
The currency data included in this version has been collected from ISO 4217, the International Organization for Standardization's standard for currency codes and names.

Conversion to JSON Format:
We meticulously transformed the currency data obtained from ISO 4217 into a structured JSON format. Each currency entry comprises its unique currency code, commonly used currency name, and any additional attributes deemed pertinent for our purposes.

Purpose:
The primary objective of this version is to establish a comprehensive dataset for currency attributes, ensuring consistency and accuracy. By leveraging ISO 4217 as our source, we aim to provide a reliable and standardized reference for currency-related information.

Future Considerations:
While Version 1 lays a robust foundation, we envision subsequent iterations to incorporate further enhancements, including:

- Integration of supplementary data sources to enrich the dataset with additional currency attributes and metadata.
- Expansion of the dataset to encompass broader currency-related information and facilitate diverse financial analysis and reporting needs.
