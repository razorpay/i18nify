Data Source:
The timezone data has been meticulously sourced from Wikipedia, a widely recognized and authoritative online encyclopedia.

Conversion to JSON Format:
We diligently converted the timezone data obtained from Wikipedia into a structured JSON format. Each country entry includes its respective timezone information, including al available timezones in the country, and offsets

Purpose:
The primary objective of this version is to establish a comprehensive dataset for country timezone attributes, facilitating accurate timekeeping and scheduling across various regions and applications. By leveraging Wikipedia as our source, we aim to provide a reliable and standardized reference for timezone-related information globally.

Future Considerations:
While Version 1 represents a foundational step, we anticipate future iterations to incorporate additional enhancements, including:
- Integration of supplementary data sources to enrich the dataset with more detailed timezone attributes and daylight saving time transitions.
- Expansion of the dataset to encompass broader timezone-related metadata.
